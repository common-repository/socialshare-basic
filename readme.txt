SocialShare allows you to lock your content behind a likewall using simple shortcodes.

== Description ==

SocialShare was created to make it easy to distribute various types of media while keeping it simple for the end user. Instructions for using each feature are listed below, if you have any questions feel free to drop us a line.

= Code or Text Snippets =
`[socialshare-snippet]This is an example of the snippet shortcode[/socialshare-snippet]`

You can wrap any amount of text in the snippet shortcode, from a single line to a multi-page example of HTML/CSS code. The text snippet will be automatically color coded based on it's detected language(HTML, PHP, CSS, etc...). After the link has been shared, the user will have the option to copy the content to the clipboard or to view the code without copying it.

*Usage: Code Samples, Literary Quotes, Directions*

= Download Links =
`[socialshare-download href="http://www.yoursite.com/download-this-file.zip"]Example File Download[/socialshare-download]`

With this shortcode, you can share a download link for any sort of file (zip, jpg, pdf, etc...). The content of the shortcode should be the title of the download, and the URL of the file should be included using the href option. If the href option is not specified, the link will be displayed but will not take the user anywhere.

*Usage: PDF Forms, Audio Files, Screencasts*
